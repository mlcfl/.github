# Welcome to MLC!<br>A unified entry point to your applications — online and offline.

A platform that brings together independent modules to help you manage daily tasks.
Use it through the official website, or run it locally on your computer or on a private server in your network — with data synchronization even in offline mode.

### What the MLC is

This project is a collection of independent applications accessible through a single interface.
You can use them online or deploy everything locally — without relying on external services or a permanent internet connection. All data is synchronized between your devices, while staying under your full control.

### How to install locally

Go to the repository [beaver](https://github.com/mlcfl/beaver) and follow the installation instructions.
